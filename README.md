These programs only work with images that show the person from the front. The face must be visible.

There are two different programs included, one uses a region of interest and the other does not. This changes the processing time, but in very rare cases it can lead to errors, but it can also avoid them.

To get the programs running after downloading, you must first download the required libraries. These are in the first lines of the file. Then you have to adjust the file paths of the video file and the template. You also have to adjust the folder path where the extracted frames should be saved.
